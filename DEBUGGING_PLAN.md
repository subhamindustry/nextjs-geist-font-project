# Debugging Plan for 502 Bad Gateway Issue in Next.js App

## Objective
Isolate and identify the cause of the 502 Bad Gateway error by selectively disabling or commenting out parts of the app and verifying stability.

## Step 1: Disable API Routes
- Temporarily rename or comment out API route files (e.g., `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`) to prevent server-side code execution.
- Restart the dev server and check if the error persists.

## Step 2: Simplify Pages
- Replace complex pages (e.g., backend operator, admin dashboard) with minimal placeholder components.
- Gradually re-enable features to identify problematic code.

## Step 3: Check Context Providers
- Temporarily remove or simplify context providers (e.g., AuthProvider) to rule out context-related issues.

## Step 4: Monitor Resource Usage
- Check VM/container memory and CPU usage during server startup.
- Increase resources if possible.

## Step 5: Review Logs
- Enable verbose logging for Next.js dev server.
- Capture and analyze logs for errors or warnings.

## Step 6: Incremental Rebuild
- Rebuild the app incrementally, adding back features one by one.
- Test stability after each addition.

## Step 7: External Dependencies
- Review and update dependencies.
- Remove or replace any problematic packages.

## Deliverables
- A stable dev server running without 502 errors.
- Identification of the root cause.
- Fixes or workarounds applied.
